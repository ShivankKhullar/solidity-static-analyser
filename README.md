# Solidity Static Analyser 🛡️

Welcome to the Solidity Static Analyser project. This tool is designed to analyze Solidity smart contracts to uncover potential vulnerabilities, ensuring the robustness and security of Ethereum projects.

## Introduction 🌟

Developed by [Shivank Khullar](https://github.com/ShivankKhullar) during a summer internship at Brunel University, this project was guided by [Dr. Rumyana Neykova](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/rumyana-neykova). The collaboration aimed to create a tool that not only identifies vulnerabilities in smart contracts but also serves as a foundation for future research papers in the domain.

## Key Achievements 🏆

- **Metrics Extraction**: The current version of the tool is primarily focused on extracting a variety of metrics from smart contracts, including Halstead, OOP metrics, and count metrics.
- **Rapid Development**: A significant accomplishment, especially considering the project's development spanned just one month.

## Purpose & Future Directions 🚀

- **Insightful Analysis**: Beyond its immediate functionality, the insights derived from this tool will contribute to forthcoming research papers, shedding light on the intricacies of smart contract vulnerabilities.
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: The primary goal is to provide clients with a comprehensive dashboard to assess the quality of Ethereum projects.
- **Ongoing Development**: The analysis part, aimed at interpreting the extracted metrics to identify vulnerabilities, is currently under development and will be a part of future releases.
